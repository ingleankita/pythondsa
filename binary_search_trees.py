""" Binary Search Trees:
- The height k of a binary search tree is the number of levels in the tree starting from level 0 (root).
- At any level k', # of nodes n = n^(k').
- At the leaf level (k-1), # of nodes, n = 2^(k-1).
- To store a total of N nodes (records) we need a balanced search tree of height at least [log(N) + 1]."""
